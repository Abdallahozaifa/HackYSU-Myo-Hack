Build Bugz a game build with an Html 5 canvas, Javascript game engine, and with the help of the sweet alert library. It came together very smoothly. 

The Javascript game engine functions as a flipbook and continues to render the images that it is given repeatedly over 50 times per second approximately. The game assets and functionality can be found on app.js and engine.js, resource.js serves a way to cache the common images used in the application to speed up the game's performance. The game starts off with a start screen that explains the rules and controls of the game, then the start screen disappears and the renders the character screen. After the player selects a user a timed sweet alert pops up and outputs the objectives of the game. After that the game starts and different colored bugs begin crawling across the screen. The player must obtain all 5 keys to unlock a hidden door and proceed to that door. The player can then obtain the gems for a higher score. Every collision with a bug or water near the keys results in one loss in life. The player can obtain a life every three levels. Link can be found below.
